For a long time now,
 I’ve wanted to write
 to you, but found 
myself unable.
 Not from illness—
although that came 
and went—but 
because I refuse 
to put something 
in your inbox that
 I feel isn’t worth your time. 

The endless stream
 of events that the world 
provides to remark upon 
has the tendency to take 
on an almost physical weight,
 and robs me of what I 
can only describe 
as origination energy:
 the creative spark that
 empowers us not simply 
to do something, but 
to do something new.
 Without it, even 
the best of what I
 can produce feels 
derivative and workmanlike—
good enough for government, 
perhaps, but not good 
enough for you.

I suspect you may know a similar struggle—
you can tell me how you fight it below, 
if you like—but my only means
 for overcoming it is
 an aimless wandering in search of the
 unknown catalyst that might help me 
to refill my emptied well
. Where once I might have had a good 
chance of walking away inspired by the empathy
 I felt while watching a sad, 
sad film, achieving 
such inspiration feels 
harder now, somehow. I 
have to search farthe
r, and wander longer, across centuries of pa
inting and music until at last, when passing by a dumpster, yes
terday’s internet comment might sud
denly pop into my head and blossom there, as i
f a poem. The thing—
the artifact itself—doesn’t 
matter, so much as what 
it does for me—it enlivens me.
This, to me, is art.
