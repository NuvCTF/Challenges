On the gates of Vormir you arrive, finally. The perillious journey across the Universe in search of the stones that legend says are the source of all power in the Universe, as you go towards taking the final piece, a shadowy figure appears, as you look at the mighty protector of the soul stone, he tells you about the sacrifice that you need to make, but legend has it that there is something you tell him from his old days, which shall allow you to pass. Tell Red Skull what he longs to hear, and the soul stone shall be yours.
