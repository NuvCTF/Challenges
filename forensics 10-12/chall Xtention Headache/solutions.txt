info :


The Flag.txt file is the hexdump for the origional flag.txt that has been repeateadly compressed 


Hint: commands to be used bzip2,tar,xxd,gzip,mv



file Flag.txt to know that the file reads as Ascii text but we know through the 
hint that the file's last compression is as a hexdump so we hit xxd -r Flag.txt then we hit file _filename to know the next extention of the flag and so on
